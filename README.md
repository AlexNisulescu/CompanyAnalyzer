## Introduction

This script was created from the need to simplify the way I analyze the financial data of companies.

## Requirements

The script was tested and currently works with:

* Python 3.9.10
* yfinance 0.1.74
* pandas 1.4.4
* openpyxl 3.0.10

If Python is already installed, you can install the packages with:

    pip3 install pandas yfinance

The script will use a text file named Tickers to download the required data.
The data downloaded by it is:

* Sector
* Industry
* MarketCap
* P/E
* Current Price
* Return on Equity
* Return on Assets
* Current Ratio
* Debt to Equity
* Profit Margins
* Gross Margins
* Five Years Average Dividend Yield
* Last Dividend Value
* Three-Year Average Return
* Five-Year Average Return
* Total Cash
* Total Assets
* Total Debt
* Forward P/E

## How to use it

Syntax:

    python3 companyanalyzer.py

The script has no options required at running, except the existence of Tickers where they will need to be placed on a new row the tickers of the companies which you want to analyze.
